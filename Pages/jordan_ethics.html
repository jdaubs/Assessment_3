    <h1>Jordan's Ethical Reflection</h1>

    <p>There are many ethical issues related to AI (Artificial Intelligence), especially when it comes to how AI impacts jobs in New Zealand. It has been a known factor for a <br>while 
      that AI will take over automated jobs done by humans, effectively replacing them (Stahl, B.C., 2021). This is a huge ethical factor, that hasn’t been thought on <br>too well in my 
      opinion. Based on the research me and my teammates completed, I can see how much AI has, and will change jobs in New Zealand in the future. A <br>quote from Norbert Wiener bleakly 
      sums up the eventuality of the impacts of AI on jobs; “It is perfectly clear that this will produce an unemployment situation, <br>in comparison with which the present recession and 
      even the depression of the thirties will seem a pleasant joke” (Stahl, B.C, 2021). However true this is, it is very <br>negative. There are always the risks of jobs being replaced by 
      AI, that is a simple fact that many have yet to accept. AI replacing automated jobs also has major <br>ethical implications on the economy in New Zealand and how middle to lower class 
      individuals can get money. Without money people won't be able to afford <br>necessities, it can negatively impact their mental health as they worry about how they will survive day after 
      day. AI would be helping the upper-class and <br>businesspeople who take the opportunity to choose AI technology to advance their own business, but it is important to consider how it 
      will impact lower to <br>middle class individuals and family's socio-economic status and mental health. I would recommend people to not be closed off to the opportunities AI can bring <br>
      us. Yes, it will replace automated jobs by humans, but it can bring so many more opportunities for humanity, including new jobs.  
      
      <br>
      <br>

      I feel despite the negative ethical issues to consider, there is something to gain from AI and that there is a positive side. Having AI take over autonomous jobs is <br>good in the way that 
      it will be able to replace dangerous jobs. Even picking fruits or farming is dangerous as the sun can damage people over time. I personally <br>feel though, that AI can inspire many people to 
      take up studying certain fields such as computer science, engineering, biology, and even chemistry as they can <br>all be relevant to AI. AI is going to be a huge factor in our future and 
      advancements as humans it’s our job to learn and adapt to new times. I recommend that <br>people should take this as an opportunity to learn what they are passionate about because you never know, 
      it may be valuable to AI advancements and ethical <br>concerns around AI.</p>
