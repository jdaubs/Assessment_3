<h1>Choices for New Zealand Jobs in AI</h1>

</ul><h4><p>Choices for New Zealand Jobs with AI</p></h4>

<br>

<p>There are many choices that New Zealand has already made to develop and integrate 
  AI (Artificial Intelligence) into the country. Majority of the AI that New <br> Zealand 
  has adapted already is in the health sector. Private hospitals tend to have more AI 
  developed in their sector than public hospitals. MercyAscot is a <br> private healthcare 
  provider in New Zealand who are embracing AI. According to the report, Artificial 
  Intelligence for Health in New Zealand (Artificial <br> Intelligence for Health in New 
  Zealand, page 26, October 2019), Mercy Ascot has experimented with cloud storage 
  services to store data such as HR and project <br> management related materials in a cloud 
  for security reasons. MercyAscot has partnered with Umbrellar to ensure their 
  electronic medical records system can <br> be hosted securely in a cloud instead of 
  paper-based records. This has allowed MercyAscot to reduce the time spent looking for 
  records and given them more <br> workspace as they would not need tons of filing cabinets 
  to store the records anymore. By experimenting and moving to a cloud storage facility, 
  MercyAscot are <br> now able to use tools such as machine learning and advanced analytics. 
  Mercy Radiology has implemented a robotic atomisation solution for invoicing that was 
  <br> developed in partnership with Virtual Blue. Matilda, a software trained robot, automates 
  invoicing and paperwork, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. This releases <br> humans to tackle 
  more challenging tasks that would otherwise not be done due to the lack of time. 
  MercyAscot have also integrated Volpara Health Technologies' <br> breast screening solution. 
  This breast screening solution employs AI to optimise the breast screening image. Volpara 
  Health Technologies’ (Volpara Health, 2022) <br> breast screening solution is a clinically 
  confirmed, AI powered software for personalised screening and early detection of breast 
  cancer.  </p>

  <br>
  <br>
  
  <p>Currently many medical images are evaluated and reported on by two human specialists to 
    prevent error and ensure that the diagnosis, if any is correct. By <br> implementing AI into 
    the breast screening process, the AI could screen the images as the first screen and pass 
    on any irregular screenings to the human <br> specialist for further analysis and follow-ups. 
    This frees up a specialist to accommodate for more patients to be seen to. This allows for 
    early detection to take <br> place and in my opinion, the possibility of less people dying from 
    cancer if detected early enough for treatment to take place.  </p>

  <br>
  <br>

  <p>New Zealand has not integrated AI into many industries at this current stage, but I believe 
    that the more AI proves to be beneficial and correct in the health <br> system, the more industries 
    will start to adapt to incorporate it into theirs. Many people believe that AI can be dangerous 
    to their jobs and have the potential <br> of making them unemployed. These people tend to have little 
    knowledge of what AI is and have been given misinformation. In 2016, The Ministry of Health 
    <br> implemented a strategy (Artificial Intelligence for Health in New Zealand, page 12, October 2019) 
    ‘New Zealand Health Strategy’ that emphasised five strategic <br> themes: People powered, closer to 
    home, smart system, value and high performance and one team. By implementing more AI into the 
    health sector, New Zealand <br> will be able to achieve all these themes as it allows for 
    more specialists to be freed from tedious, repetitive jobs that we know AI can already aid 
    with. This will <br> allow for more patients to be seen and cheaper fees for these patients as less 
    human knowledge is needed to diagnose diseases. The more New Zealand health <br> sectors introduce AI 
    into their ever day jobs the more society will trust AI and allow for it to grow and help other 
    industries.  </p>
