<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>

</ul><h4><p>Opportunities for New Zealand Jobs with AI</p></h4>
<p>There are many opportunities in the field of AI (Artificial Intelligence) 
  advancements that NZ could take, it can impact New Zealanders jobs in several 
  <br> ways through either removing the jobs and/or creating new jobs. What is eventually 
  chosen is up to the country and the current/future opportunities. <br> There are many
   global opportunities NZ could take to advance the country in many job fields. 
   A Stanford University article (Standford University, 2021) <br> mentions many 
   opportunities in AI, such as: “AI for Augmentation”, “Drawing Insights”, 
   “Assisting with Decision-Making”, “AI as Assistant”, and “AI <br> Agents on their 
   own”, and with each new opportunities comes new jobs. In terms of what 
   opportunities New Zealand would take in, our team has a strong <br> feeling New 
   Zealand would go forward with more agricultural and/or small business 
   opportunities given via AI advancements.  </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>One opportunity that could apply more for New Zealand is “Drawing Insights”, 
  specifically more with the agricultural industry. According to a New Zealand 
  <br> document by aiforum, AI has the opportunity to impact New Zealand's 
  agricultural industry in many ways such as: “yield optimisation, 
  addressing labour <br> shortages, meat alternative research, real time risk 
  management along the supply chain, assurance of the quality of food with 
  traceability, providing food <br> security through locating and isolating disease 
  outbreaks in animals and plants, waste reduction within the supply chain, 
  biosecurity, conversion efficiency <br> on farm linked to animal health, and 
  sustainability, valuation and insurance” (Aiforum, 2018) With these 
  opportunities comes more jobs for New Zealanders <br> such as people who work in 
  the AI field. Alongside all the benefits listed before, AI can help the 
  farmers manage their farm through data. This can then allow <br> them to 
  make their own decisions based on the data provided. According to the same 
  website, this would be referred to as “assistive technology” where it <br> can 
  help the farmer on important aspects of their farm or help to guide them. 
  An example provided by aiforum on how the farmers could use the assistive 
 <br> technology would be with animal monitoring. AI would be able to show the 
  farmer information on, for example, a cow. It was mentioned that SenseHubtm 
  <br> uses either ear tags or collars to monitor a cow's fertility or health. This 
  in turn maximises the cow's profitability for the farmer and reduces management 
  <br> costs. The more farmers that utilise this type of AI, the better. This is because
   with more data AI becomes more accurate and so in the end it only benefits NZ 
  <br> farmers.  </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Another opportunity that New Zealand can take is regarding its agricultural labour 
  shortage. AI can help combat the issues of accessibility, availability, and <br> 
  costs that are hitting NZs agriculture industry.  Due to these issues, there 
  is a need for solutions. AI is the solution. With AI, NZ can take the 
  opportunity to <br> address its labour shortage by getting AI operated machinery 
  which can take over autonomous jobs. Specifically in NZ, an example of this 
  machinery would be <br> “robotic milking sheds and, in horticulture, fruit 
  picking robots” (aiforum, 2018). Having this technology would eliminate the 
  need for such automated jobs and <br> so it would in the long run increase a 
  farmer's profitability after investing in such machines, but it would impact human
   automated jobs as they would be <br> taken away because of AI replacing them. 
   This technology as a matter of fact exists, it’s up to New Zealand to grab the 
   opportunity for advancement in the <br> agricultural industry as it is a major 
   form of profit for the country.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>A final opportunity that will be addresses that New Zealand can take which 
  impacts jobs can be regarding biosecurity for the agricultural industry. Taking 
  the <br> opportunity to improve New Zealand's biosecurity through AI can help 
  generate more jobs around the science industry around biology, chemistry, and 
  computer <br> science. AI can help the biosecurity sector through detecting 
  diseases and disease outbreaks in animals and plants and also provide 
  predictive models for isolation <br> (Aiforum, 2018). Overall, it can increase 
  food security which can make New Zealand even more of a trustworthy exporter 
  of goods. </p>
