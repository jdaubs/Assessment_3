<h1>Opportunities for New Zealand Jobs in AI</h1>

<h4>Opportunities for New Zealand Jobs with AI</h4>

<br>

<p>It is said that 30% of autonomous jobs will be taken over by AI (Vega, M 2022). This can be viewed negatively, 
  however there are many opportunities in the field <br> of AI (Artificial Intelligence) advancements that NZ could take, 
  it can impact New Zealanders jobs in several ways through either removing the jobs and/or <br> creating new jobs. What 
  is eventually chosen is up to the country and the current/future opportunities. There are many global opportunities 
  NZ could take to <br> advance the country in many job fields. A Stanford University article (Standford University, 2021) 
  mentions many opportunities in AI, such as: “AI for <br> Augmentation”, “Drawing Insights”, “Assisting with Decision-Making”, 
  “AI as Assistant”, and “AI Agents on their own”, and with each new opportunities comes <br> new jobs. In terms of what 
  opportunities New Zealand would take in, our team has a strong feeling New Zealand would go forward with more 
  agricultural and/or <br> small business opportunities given via AI advancements.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>One opportunity that could apply more for New Zealand is “Drawing Insights”, specifically more with the agricultural 
  industry. According to a New Zealand <br> document by AIforum, AI has the opportunity to impact New Zealand's agricultural 
  industry in many ways such as: “yield optimisation, addressing labour <br> shortages, meat alternative research, real time 
  risk management along the supply chain, assurance of the quality of food with traceability, providing food <br> security 
  through locating and isolating disease outbreaks in animals and plants, waste reduction within the supply chain, 
  biosecurity, conversion efficiency <br> on farm linked to animal health, and sustainability, valuation and insurance” 
  (AIforum, 2018) With these opportunities comes more jobs for New Zealanders <br> such as people who work in the AI field. 
  Alongside all the benefits listed before, AI can help the farmers manage their farm through data. This can then allow <br> 
  them to make their own decisions based on the data provided. According to the same website, this would be referred to 
  as “assistive technology” where it <br> can help the farmer on important aspects of their farm or help to guide them. An 
  example provided by aiforum on how the farmers could use the assistive <br> technology would be with animal monitoring. 
  AI would be able to show the farmer information on, for example, a cow. It was mentioned that SenseHubtm <br> uses either 
  ear tags or collars to monitor a cow's fertility or health. This in turn maximises the cow's profitability for the 
  farmer and reduces management <br> costs. The more farmers that utilise this type of AI, the better. This is because with 
  more data AI becomes more accurate and so in the end it only benefits NZ <br> farmers.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>
  Another opportunity that New Zealand can take is regarding its agricultural labour shortage. AI can help combat the 
  issues of accessibility, availability, and <br> costs that are hitting New Zealand’s agriculture industry. The agriculture 
  industry in New Zealand generates the country a lot of profit, it is said that it <br> generates 40% of the $80 billion 
  annual exports for New Zealand (Skerrett, A. 2019). Due to these labor shortage issues and the importance of the <br> 
  agricultural industry for New Zealand's economy, there is a need for solutions. AI is the solution. With AI, NZ can 
  take the opportunity to address its labour <br> shortage by getting AI operated machinery which can take over autonomous 
  jobs. Specifically in NZ, an example of this machinery would be “robotic milking <br> sheds and, in horticulture, fruit 
  picking robots” (aiforum, 2018). Having this technology would eliminate the need for such automated jobs and so it 
  would in <br> the long run increase a farmer's profitability after investing in such machines, but it would impact human 
  automated jobs as they would be taken away <br> because of AI replacing them. This technology in fact exists, it is up to 
  New Zealand to grab the opportunity for advancement in the agricultural industry as it <br> is a major form of profit for 
  the country.</p>

<br>
<br>

<p>
  A final opportunity that will be addresses that New Zealand can take which impacts jobs can be regarding biosecurity 
  for the agricultural industry. Taking the <br> opportunity to improve New Zealand's biosecurity through AI can help 
  generate more jobs around the science industry around biology, chemistry, and computer <br> science. AI can help the 
  biosecurity sector through detecting diseases and disease outbreaks in animals and plants and also provide predictive 
  models for <br> isolation (AIforum, 2018). Overall, it can increase food security which can make New Zealand even more of a 
  trustworthy exporter of goods.</p>
