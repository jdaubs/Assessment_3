<h1>Risks for New Zealand Jobs with AI</h1>
<h4>Risks for New Zealand Jobs with AI</h4>
<br>
<br>
<p>What are the risks that AI poses to the jobs in New Zealand in the near future? As 
  Artificial Intelligence progresses, we become more reliant on it to do many of <br> our 
  basic or repetitive tasks. This has become a more practical use of the company's money 
  and effort to produce products around New Zealand. As AI rises <br> many people have adapted 
  different views on what this might in tale for the ethical and economical state of New 
  Zealand. There are a large number of people <br> who believe AI will be beneficial to jobs in 
  New Zealand, even stating that it will open opportunities for more jobs in New Zealand. 
  Others argue that many jobs <br> around New Zealand will in time render all use of a human’s 
  touch. Many fear the loss of jobs in this new era of rising technology. The Artificial 
  Intelligence’s <br> addition to jobs previously done by humans could push people out of their 
  jobs and could only leave room for Maintenance and computer scientists to have <br> remaining 
  jobs. Many people will feel forced to study in the field of computer science to find 
  sustaining jobs in a country which is progressively getting more <br> comfortable with AI 
  taking over even the most simplistic of jobs being, retail jobs to other customer 
  services jobs. If there is anything AI can do already, it is <br> communication and speech 
  which is what is most important in all jobs around New Zealand. Therefore, AI poses a 
  massive threat to people across the country <br> who are heavily working in 
  communication-based jobs. Another side in which AI is said to affect is the farming 
  industry, with new mechanisms being built lately <br> it will not be long till New Zealand 
  resorts to mechanized mechanisms to do a farmer's job, it is not far-fetched and is a 
  very real risk AI poses. Many farmers who <br> have put their life’s work into farming will 
  have devastating consequences when their jobs get replaced by machines.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Farming is a routine work, which is why it will not be difficult to program certain machines 
  to do certain farming jobs, this for New Zealand as a country will be <br> a more efficient way of 
  producing farmed goods to sell to the markets. A few examples of this happening are Abundant 
  Robotics' apple picking robot, which is <br> being used to pick apples and other types of fruit. 
  There are many other robots being introduced to NZ farms. People have started using AI to 
  precisely plant and <br> grow certain vegetables and fruits, though it is estimated by New 
  Zealanders around the country that they will start incorporating AI and robotics into care and <br>
  farming routines towards farm animals. These are the risks that AI poses for jobs in New Zealand. 
  The thought of job loss in New Zealand has been given more <br> attention, driven by books with titles 
  such as ‘Jobpocalypse: The end of human jobs and how robots will replace them’ 
  (Author: Ben Way, 2013) The book <br> essentially talks about how robots and AI will affect employment 
  and jobs over the next thirty years. Another example of Affecting jobs, and therefore being a <br> risk, 
  is AI’s inclusion in the automobile business. Although the creation of the automobile didn't 
  exactly render blacksmithing as a job useless, it certainly did <br> lower the demand for the job. 
  Early cars were built by teams of mechanics, however it all changed when Henry Ford moved the 
  production of his Model ‘T’ onto <br> a production line. This sped up production for cars and highly 
  lowered the need for direct labor by mechanics.  Many started to lose the satisfaction of their job, <br>
  status, and bargaining power that went with being a trained mechanic.</p>
