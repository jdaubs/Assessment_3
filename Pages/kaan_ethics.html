    <h1>Kaan's Ethical Reflection:</h1>
    <h2>By the research I have collected about Ai's effect on jobs in New Zealand, I can say that although it is a long time away, technology may have the potential to take most of our jobs.<br> I believe that there is definitely a slight uprising in technology as of recent years, as the years progress so does the technology.<br> And technology is progressing at such a pace. I believe in no shorter than 30 years, AI will have almost full control of many easy to handle and routine jobs around New Zealand.<br> It is apparent that some jobs such as automobile business and farming businesses have already been mixed with smart technology in order to achieve a more efficient work fole.<br> Businesses such as the farming and automobile industry are ones where their products are very important and to maintain and keep consistent, that the most efficient solution thought up, was the incorporation of AI. this would make it so that their products could get out easier and more quickly with minimum to no problems. However I believe the use of AI in jobs is not only limited to business such as the ones I have discussed. <br>No, I believe that businesses like food delivery and package services also have the potential of being overtaken by AI. As these are jobs which have a routine that can be easily followed and re[;icated by a well coded robot or machine. So far, AI has been directed towards other things, such as phones, satellites and networking, however it is not long until New Zealand's starts to incorporate it into basic jobs with easy routines. Another job not often addressed, that AI has the potential to take over is, cleaning and care services. Services which provide maintenance for homes, people and  cars. For example maids could be replaced with Ai driven robots which can clean the house and achieve everyday chores. Same goes for gardening. Personally I believe that technology has its benefits but taking over most jobs will take a while. For example, there are robots but, robots aren't fully intelligent and none have even come close to human agility, reflex and intelligence. Also with self-driving cars, they are only just starting to be produced and have many problems and data storage issues. AI is a process which takes time and experience to become intelligent and until that is achieved, our jobs are not in danger. </h2>
