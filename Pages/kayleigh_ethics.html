    <h1>Kayleigh's Ethical Reflection</h1>
    
    <p>There are many definitions and conspiracy theories surrounding Artificial Intelligence 
      (AI). I believe that many people are afraid of what AI has to offer due to the <br> minimal 
      level of knowledge that they have about it. There are many people who believe that 
      integrating AI into New Zealand is not a promising idea. Society has <br> created the idea 
      that AI is dangerous for people’s jobs and that machines can take over everything. However, 
      I think that this idea of AI is wrong. AI machines will <br> replace many jobs that are 
      repetitive and mundane. However more complex jobs will be more difficult for a machine to 
      takeover. According to Bernard Marr, <br> “there will be jobs today that machines will take over” 
     <a href="https://bernardmarr.com/what-are-the-negative-impacts-of-artificial-intelligence-ai/">
      (Bernard Marr, What Are The Negative Impacts Of Artificial Intelligence (AI)? 2021)</a>  this is 
      true, and we have <br> seen it with Virtual Blue’s Matilda 
      <a href="https://aiforum.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AI-For-Health-in-New-Zealand.pdf">
      (Artificial Intelligence for Health in New Zealand, October 
      2019)</a>:  a software trained robot, automates invoicing and paperwork, 
      <br> 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Matilda has replaced the humans that use to do these 
      repetitive tasks.   </p>

      <br>
      <br>

      <p>However, there are many people who believe if AI is integrated into New Zealand businesses 
        it will bring positive influences on the working world. This is because <br> AI machines can 
        complete mundane and repetitive tasks that us as humans have to do. Allowing us as humans 
        more time during our workday to tackle more <br> challenging and important tasks at hand. For 
        example, Virtual Blue’s Matilda 
        <a href="https://aiforum.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/AI-For-Health-in-New-Zealand.pdf">
        (Artificial Intelligence for Health in New Zealand, October 
        2019)</a> . Matilda has freed up <br> the humans that used to perform these tasks and given them more 
        time to tackle tasks that are more important. Jobs such as customer service cannot be 
        <br> replaced by machines due to the lack of emotion that machines have. Customer Service 
        specialists provide emotion and a sense of security for people as they can <br> sympathise and 
        reply with emotion when needed.  </p>

        <br>
        <br>

        <p>In my opinion the quicker New Zealand integrate AI into our businesses the better it will 
          be for society as it gives us all time to adapt and learn what AI has to offer <br> for all. 
          Even if it means some jobs will be replaced, more jobs will become available as someone 
          needs to fix the broken machine when it does not do the specified <br> job it was created to do.  </p>
